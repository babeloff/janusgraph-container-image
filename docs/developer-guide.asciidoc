The Janusgraph source includes a number of configuration files.
These are properties files.
We use `yq` to edit the Janusgraph configuration files.
See link:operator-guide.asciidoc[the Operator Guide].
At present `yq` does not read java properties files (although it does produce them).
The problem is resolved by converting the java properties configuration files
provided with Janusgraph into `yaml` files using
link:https://github.com/Codearte/props2yaml[props2yaml].
